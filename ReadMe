The following tools are free to use, 
Publishing them or selling them under another name is illegal
It is forbidden to run them on Soft or Hardware which do not belong to you
The purpose of these programs is to work quicker, as Mac OS does not have a version of them in the Terminal

To create shortcut put the following into your .cshrc or .bash
alias hmi 'python /PATHTOFILE/how_many_items.py '
alias tree2 'python /PATHTOFILE/tree.py '

HMI counts the items in one's directory
TREE gives you a graphic visualisation of the directories (Version for python 3 is tree3.py)
